# React Intro

A little introduction of React JS

The main idea is to present ReactJS with this project during an after work. The presentation must be around twenty minutes. The goal is to develop a Todo App (yeah is a little bin uncommon, don't you think).

It's not written in ES6 but if someone want to migrate, we will be pleased.

## Workshop plan

1. Creating our first components
2. Introduce data with props
3. Create a stateful component
4. Introduce Flux with Redux 
5. And so on...
